# Compatibility

## Websites

The Glean JavaScript SDK for websites is explicitly tested in
all the latest versions of major browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, Edge and Safari).

The following list, details the minimum supported version for each major browser.
All of the listed versions are explicitly tested.

| Browser | Minimum Supported Version |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Firefox | 60 |
| Google Chrome  | 66 |
| Edge    | 80[^1] |
| Safari  | 11.1 |

[^1]: We were not able to test on previous versions of the Edge browser, so Glean might work on them even though they are not explicitly tested.

The Opera and Brave browsers are not explicitly tested, however are unofficially supported
as Chromium based browsers.
